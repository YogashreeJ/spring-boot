Global Exception Handling
Overview

Global Exception Handling is implemented to handle all application-level exceptions in a centralized and consistent manner.

This avoids:

        Repetitive try-catch blocks

        Unclear or inconsistent error responses

        Exposure of internal errors to clients

Implementation

        @ControllerAdvice is used to create a global exception handler

        @ExceptionHandler methods handle specific exception types

Exceptions Handled

        Validation errors (MethodArgumentNotValidException)

        Resource not found exceptions

        Invalid input exceptions

        Generic runtime exceptions

Each exception returns:

        HTTP status code

        Error message

        Timestamp (optional)

        Field-specific error details (for validation failures)

Benefits of Global Exception Handling

        Clean controller code

        Consistent API error responses

        Better debugging and logging

        Improved client experience

Why This Matters

        This project follows industry-standard backend practices:

        Defensive programming

        Input validation
        
        Clean error handling

        Scalable and maintainable architecture

        These practices are commonly expected in real-world Spring Boot applications and technical interviews.
