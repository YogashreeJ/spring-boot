**JDBC vs Spring JDBC vs ORM vs JPA**

1️⃣ Normal JDBC

Uses 7 steps (load driver, connection, statement, execute, result set, close, etc.)

Mostly written in repository (DAO) layer

High boilerplate code

Error-prone (manual resource management)

📌 Used rarely in modern applications

2️⃣ Spring JDBC

Simplifies normal JDBC

Removes boilerplate (no manual connection / result set handling)

Uses JdbcTemplate

Still SQL-centric

Developer maps rows manually

📌 Better than JDBC, but still not ideal for complex apps

3️⃣ ORM (Object Relational Mapping)

Technique to map:

Class → Table

Fields → Columns

Object → Row

Eliminates manual SQL for CRUD

Works at object level, not table level

📌 ORM is a concept, not a framework

4️⃣ ORM Tool – Hibernate

Hibernate is an ORM implementation

Automatically:

Generates SQL

Maps objects ↔ tables

Manages persistence lifecycle

Most popular ORM tool in Java ecosystem

📌 Hibernate ≠ JPA (important distinction)

5️⃣ JPA (Java Persistence API)

Specification / standard, not an implementation

Defines:

Annotations (@Entity, @Id, etc.)

Rules for ORM behavior

ORM tools (Hibernate, EclipseLink) implement JPA

📌 Advantage:

Easy to switch ORM providers without changing much code

6️⃣ Spring Data JPA

Spring abstraction on top of JPA

Uses ORM tools (usually Hibernate internally)

Eliminates DAO boilerplate

Provides:

JpaRepository

Built-in CRUD methods

Pagination, sorting, query methods

Working with H2 In-Memory Database

H2 is a lightweight in-memory database

Data is stored in RAM, not disk

Data is lost when the application stops

Mainly used for development and testing

📌 Advantage: No external DB setup required

@Entity Annotation

Marks a class as a JPA entity

Each entity maps to a database table

Class name becomes table name by default

Must have:

No-args constructor

Non-final class

📌 Managed by the persistence context

@Id Annotation

Marks the primary key of the entity

Each entity must have exactly one @Id

Used by JPA to uniquely identify records

📌 Often combined with @GeneratedValue

Changing H2 Username & Password (application.properties)
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
spring.datasource.username=admin
spring.datasource.password=admin123

spring.h2.console.enabled=true
spring.h2.console.path=/h2-console


Default H2 username: sa

Password can be customized

Console helps inspect tables and data

📌 Used only in non-production environments

Built-in Methods from Spring Data JPA

By extending:

JpaRepository<Entity, ID>


You automatically get:

save()

findById()

findAll()

deleteById()

existsById()

count()

Pagination & sorting support
