DTO (Data Transfer Object)
What is a DTO?

A DTO is a simple object used to transfer data between application layers without exposing internal entities.

Why DTOs are Used

Hide sensitive data

Prevent exposing database structure

Decouple API from database changes

Shape data according to client requirements

Avoid serialization and lazy-loading issues

DTO vs Entity

Entity represents database tables

DTO represents API data

Entities should not be returned directly

DTOs are safe to expose

Types of DTOs

Request DTO – receives data from client

Response DTO – sends data to client

Characteristics of DTOs

No business logic

No database annotations

Contains only required fields

Used mainly in controllers

Benefits

Cleaner API design

Better security

More maintainable code

Easier versioning of APIs
